# Make-Your-Own-CLI-Editor

Yelo, this week we want you to try and make your own Command Line Editor.. that is, a command line application that allows you to both create and edit files.

## What is a file?

Abstracted somewhat, a file can be no more than a list of lines.

```
File = String[] lines
```

You may expand this if you wish, but you need not do so.

## What do we do?

### Level 1

* You should be able to open it, type stuff and then save it under a filename you choose
* You should be able to open a file using a filename as an argument and append to them

### level 2

* Edit existing files, delete lines, add lines, change lines, swap lines, etc

### level 3

* Syntax Highlighting?
* Aditional CLI arguments or internal commands? (think Vim)

## The end

Nope, that really is it.. short and sweet, get designing!
