Open it, type stuff, save it to a file
Open a file using its name as an argument
Print the contents of a file
Edit existing files via simple appending or replacement of lines
```
Extensions..
```
Search for keywords in a file
Delete lines from a file
Add lines within a file
Swap lines in the file
Aditional CLI arguments / internal commands
```
And for the insane..
